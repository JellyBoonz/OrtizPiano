These changes cause the piano's wooden components to expand and contract, affecting the tension of the strings and ultimately the pitch. This is why we recommend tuning your piano at least twice a year - ideally in spring and fall when the weather transitions are most significant."

For home pianos used for regular practice, quarterly tuning is recommended."
